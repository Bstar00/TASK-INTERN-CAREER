Functions:
Basic Information:

Displays general information about the dataset, including data types and missing values.
Summary Statistics:

Presents statistical summary measures (count, mean, std, min, 25%, 50%, 75%, max) for each numerical column.
Cleaning and Conversion:

Cleans the 'Mileage' column by removing units ('km/kg' and 'kmpl') and converts it to numeric values.
Handling Missing Values:

Checks for missing values and prints their count. Users can modify the script to handle missing values based on their requirements.
Data Filtering:

Filters data based on a user-defined mileage threshold. By default, the threshold is set to 25 kmpl.
Histogram Visualization:

Generates a histogram for the 'Kilometers Driven' column, providing a visual representation of the data distribution.
